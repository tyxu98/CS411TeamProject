As a concerned individual, I want to be aware of the status of conrona virus worldwide to see the state the world is in.

 If everything goes right, the concerned individual will be able to check the confirmed cases worldwide by clicking a button.

 Since the concerned individual simply gets a view of the data, the only possible error that can occur will be the website crashing or the API displaying the statistics stops working.

 If the concerned individual wants to share what he/she finds, please refer to the Sharing Information User Story as all information relating to this topic has been documented there.

 If the concerned individual wants to know a country's Coronavirus statistics, please refer to Coronavirus Statistics User Story as all information relating to this topic has been documented there.

If the concerned individual wants to know the CoronaVirus Statistics by state, please refer to Coronavirus stats by state User-Story.
