User Story:

As a student who wants to attend university, I want to know the confirmed corona virus cases per each country to be safer.

Description:

If everything goes right, the student should immediately reach the website and check all the coronavirus information for a specific country. Information about confirmed cases should pop up.

Since our website does not require inputs from the student, the number of errors should be approximately zero. An error might happen only if the website is crashed.

If the student wants to share their findings about coronavirus information, please refer to the Sharing Information User Story as all information related to this topic are documented there.

If a student wants to know about corona virus cases by state, please refer to Coronavirus News User Story(It have been updated to be a user story regarding corona virus by state).

If a student wants to travel to that country, please refer to the Coronavirus Travel Advisory User Story.


If the student wants to share what he/she finds, please refer to the Sharing Information User Story.
