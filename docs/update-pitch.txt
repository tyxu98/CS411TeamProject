CoronavirusStats:

We will create an web application that displays confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, by country, or by states in the US.  information for each country  and global cases will be obtained from  corona tracker api(https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11073859/Szmcbeho?version=latest#5f0ea4c9-3f98-46f7-87f2-14fee544a9c3), which will provide an updated listing of confirmed corona virus cases per country and confirmed cases world-wide. Furthermore, we will utilize a coronavirus smartable api(https://rapidapi.com/SmartableAI/api/coronavirus-smartable) that provides information on confirmed corona virus cases by states in the US. This website will allow the user to look at the corona virus cases world-wide by clicking a button, typing in a 2 letter country abbreviation and clicking a button to see confirmed cases by country, and typing in the state name and clicking a number to see confirmed cases by state. Lastly, We will also be using Oauth in order to allow users to log in to the app with their social media accounts, for which they can share their findings, and we will store what the user input history and store it in a database.
